    "1. What is the name of the feature responsible for generating Regex objects?\n",
    "    > re.compile()\n",
    "    \n",
    "2. Why do raw strings often appear in Regex objects?\n",
    "    > Because raw strings are a convenient choice when regular expression includes backlash character.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. What is the return value of the search() method?\n",
    "    > Returns matching object (or None).\n",
    "\n",
    "4. From a Match item, how do you get the actual strings that match the pattern?\n",
    "    > re.search('a', 'ababbabab') -> a - what we are searching for, second argument is a string we are looking for \n",
    "\n",
    "5. In the regex which created from the r'(\\d\\d\\d)-(\\d\\d\\d-\\d\\d\\d\\d)', what does group zero cover? Group 2? Group 1?\n",
    "    > group1 will be characters in the first pair of parantheses: (\\d\\d\\d)\n",
    "    > group 2 will be characters in the second pair of the parantheses: (\\d\\d\\d-\\d\\d\\d\\d)\n",
    "\n",
    "6. In standard expression syntax, parentheses and intervals have distinct meanings. How can you tell a regex that you want it to fit real parentheses and periods?\n",
    "    > They must be escpaed by a backlash. \\(\\d\\d\\d-\\d\\d\\d\\d)\\\n",
    "\n",
    "7. The findall() method returns a string list or a list of string tuples. What causes it to return one of the two options?\n",
    "    >  List of strings where the is only one group/or no groups in regex. List of tuples containning strings if they are matching the expression in the group if there are more than one group.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. In standard expressions, what does the | character mean?\n",
    "    > or\n",
    "    \n",
    "9. In regular expressions, what does the character stand for?\n",
    "    > either or\n",
    "    \n",
    "10.In regular expressions, what is the difference between the + and * characters?\n",
    "    > *- zero or more occurences, +- one or more occurences\n",
    "    \n",
    "11. What is the difference between {4} and {4,5} in regular expression?\n",
    "    > {4} - exactly matches 4, {4,5} - exactly matches 4 and 5\n",
    "    \n",
    "12. What do you mean by the \\d, \\w, and \\s shorthand character classes signify in regular expressions?\n",
    "    > Matches: \\d - a digit, \\w - a word character, \\s - a whitespace character (tabs and line endings)\n",
    "    \n",
    "13. What do means by \\D, \\W, and \\S shorthand character classes signify in regular expressions?\n",
    "    > Matches: \\D - a non digit, \\W - a non-word character, \\S - a non whitespace character\n",
    "\n",
    "14. What is the difference between .*? and .*?\n",
    "    > The .*? matches captures nothing. The .* matches the entirety of what's left of the string.\n",

    "15. What is the syntax for matching both numbers and lowercase letters with a character class?\n",
    "    > [a-z_0-9]\n",

    "    > re.IGNORECASE\n",
    "    \n",
    "17. What does the . character normally match? What does it match if re.DOTALL is passed as 2nd argument in re.compile()?\n",
    "    > . - math any character except for line terminators; and within the function re.DOTALL it is matching characters within the case sensitivity\n",
    "    \n",
    "18. If numReg = re.compile(r'\\d+'), what will numRegex.sub('X', '11 drummers, 10 pipers, five rings, 4 hen') return?\n",
    "    > 'X drummers, X pipers, five rings, X hen'\n",
    "\n",
    "19. What does passing re.VERBOSE as the 2nd argument to re.compile() allow to do?\n",
    "    > It allows to ignore whitespaces in regex and comments. It could be use to make more readable regex expressions.\n",
    "    \n",
    "20. How would you write a regex that match a number with comma for every three digits? It must match the given following:\n",
    "'42'\n",
    "'1,234'\n",
    "'6,368,745'\n",
    "but not the following:\n",

    "'1234' (which lacks commas)\n",
    "    > ^\\,\\d{3}$\n",
    "\n",
    "21. How would you write a regex that matches the full name of someone whose last name is Watanabe? You can assume that the first name that comes before it will always be one word that begins with a capital letter. The regex must match the following:\n",
    "'Haruto Watanabe'\n",
    "'Alice Watanabe'\n",
    "'RoboCop Watanabe'\n",
    "but not the following:\n",
    "'haruto Watanabe' (where the first name is not capitalized)\n",

    "'Haruto watanabe' (where Watanabe is not capitalized)\n",
    "    > [A-Z][A-z]+ Watanabe\n",
    "\n",
    "22. How would you write a regex that matches a sentence where the first word is either Alice, Bob, or Carol; the second word is either eats, pets, or throws; the third word is apples, cats, or baseballs; and the sentence ends with a period? This regex should be case-insensitive. It must match the following:\n",
    "'Alice eats apples.'\n",
    "'Bob pets cats.'\n",
    "'Carol throws baseballs.'\n",
    "'Alice throws Apples.'\n",
    "'BOB EATS CATS.'\n",
