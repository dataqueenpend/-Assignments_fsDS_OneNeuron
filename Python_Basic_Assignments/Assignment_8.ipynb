    "### 1. Is the Python Standard Library included with PyInputPlus?\n",
    "    > PyInputPlus is not a Python Standard Library. If we want to use it we need to install it.\n",
    "    \n",
    "### 2. Why is PyInputPlus commonly imported with import pyinputplus as pypi?\n",
    "    > It commonly imported as pypi to shorten the long name of the library and make it easier to use (like in other python libraries).\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. How do you distinguish between inputInt() and inputFloat()?\n",
    "    > First expects integer values as an imput, second one expects float value as an imput.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Using PyInputPlus, how do you ensure that the user enters a whole number between 0 and 99?\n",
    "    > We can do it by using pypi.inputInt(prompt='Enter an integer value between 0 and 99', min=0, max=99)\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. What is transferred to the keyword arguments allowRegexes and blockRegexes?\n",
    "    > With the help of allowRegexes and blockRegexes we can give a list of regular expressions strings, to accept or reject as valid input.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6. If a blank input is entered three times, what does inputStr(limit=3) do?\n",
    "    > It raises RetryLimitException excpetion.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 7. If blank input is entered three times, what does inputStr(limit=3, default=&#39;hello&#39;) do?\n",
    "    > The function will return default value instead of raising an Exception."
