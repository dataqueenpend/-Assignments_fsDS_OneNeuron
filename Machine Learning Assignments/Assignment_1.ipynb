    "### 1. What does one mean by the term \"machine learning\"?\n",
    "    > Machine learning we can call mathematical-statistical based algorithm which calculation allows us to make accurate predictions based on data available. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.Can you think of 4 distinct types of issues where it shines?\n",
    "    * Chat-bots (Customer Service Automation)\n",
    "    * Customer segmentation\n",
    "    * Price predictions\n",
    "    * Fraudelent transactions\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.What is a labeled training set, and how does it work?\n",
    "    > Labeled training set is a part of the dataset, which is prepared for traning the Machine Learning model. Labels in training set are values stored in columns of a dependent feature. In order for Supervised Machine Learning model to learn, it needs to be trained on the training set with true labels.   \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4.What are the two most important tasks that are supervised?\n",
    "    * Regression\n",
    "    * Classification\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5.Can you think of four examples of unsupervised tasks?\n",
    "    * Clustering\n",
    "    * Dimensionality Reduction\n",
    "    * Association Rules (finding relationship between vairables in dataset)\n",
    "    * Visualization (perception tasks)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6.State the machine learning model that would be best to make a robot walk through various unfamiliar terrains?\n",
    "    > Reinforced Learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 7.Which algorithm will you use to divide your customers into different groups?\n",
    "    > For example DBSCAN. It is one of the most universal and most accurate in overall unsupervised clustering algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 8.Will you consider the problem of spam detection to be a supervised or unsupervised learning problem?\n",
    "    > Supervised ML problem. We feed the model with labeled data and based on it machine learn what is spam and what is not. It is a binary classification problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 9.What is the concept of an online learning system?\n",
    "    > Machine Learning System which receives data in small batches of streaming data.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 10.What is out-of-core learning, and how does it differ from core learning?\n",
    "    > Out-of-core learning is reffering to processing data, which can't fit into single computer memory (like the core learning).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 11.What kind of learning algorithm makes predictions using a similarity measure?\n",
    "    > Instance based algorithms, like KNN. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 12.What's the difference between a model parameter and a hyperparameter in a learning algorithm?\n",
    "    * Parameters -> obligatory parameters of the model, that must be set using the traning data.\n",
    "    * Hyperparameters -> adjustable parameters, which are destined to tune model for better performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 13.What are the criteria that model-based learning algorithms look for? What is the most popular method they use to achieve success? What method do they use to make predictions?\n",
    "    > Two criteria: \n",
    "        * How bad model is in making the predictions?\n",
    "        * How much complex is the model?\n",
    "      Model-based algorithms tries to optimize model parameters with multiple runs of the cost function to find the it minimal value. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 14.Can you name four of the most important Machine Learning challenges?\n",
    "    * Overfitting, \n",
    "    * Underfitting,\n",
    "    * Not enough data, \n",
    "    * Not representative data.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 15.What happens if the model performs well on the training data but fails to generalize the results to new situations? Can you think of three different options?\n",
    "    > Overfitting. First solution we have is to get more data, resign from some 'too fitted' hyperparameters (or change their values), check out condition of the dataset (clean it, remove outliers).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 16.What exactly is a test set, and why would you need one?\n",
    "    > Part of the original data set we use for testing purpose. We check how model performs on not seen data.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 17.What is a validation set's purpose?\n",
    "    > With validation we test the best model for the problem\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 18.What precisely is the train-dev kit, when will you need it, how do you put it to use?\n",
    "    > Most times, we divide dataset into two sets - train (80%) and test (20%). But in case if we want to comapare performance of a different models or we are training Deep Learning models (which are especially hungry of a new data), we can split the original dataset to 3 parts - train (60%), dev/validation (20%) and test (20%). \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 19.What could go wrong if you use the test set to tune hyperparameters?\n",
    "    > Data leakage. Ready for production model can perform very well on the test and train data, but will be biased and probably will perform a lot worse on the new data, which it not seen. \n"
